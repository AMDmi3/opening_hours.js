master_ - unreleased
--------------------

.. _master: https://github.com/opening-hours/opening_hours.js/compare/v3.5.0...master

`v3.6.0 milestone <https://github.com/opening-hours/opening_hours.js/issues?q=milestone%3Av3.6.0+is%3Aclosed>`__

Added
~~~~~

* Translate error tolerance warnings into German. [ypid_]

Changed
~~~~~~~

* Migrated to use `ES2015 modules`_ and rollup_ for module bundling [simon04_]
* Update to holiday definition format 2.2.0. Holidays are now maintained in
  YAML files, one for each country. [ypid_]
* Rework the way Nominatim responses are handled (used for testing). [ypid_]
* Allow "gaps" in school holiday definitions. This became necessary because
  countries/states might add/remove holidays like winter holidays from one year
  to another. [ypid_]

* Error tolerance: For a value such as ``Mo-Fr 08:00-12:00 by_appointment`` the
  tool did previously suggest to use ``Mo-Fr 08:00-12:00 "on appointment"`` but
  as whether to use ``by appointment`` or ``on appointment`` is not defined the
  tool now just uses the already given variant (``Mo-Fr 08:00-12:00 "by
  appointment"`` in this case). [ypid_]

* Make error tolerance warnings translatable. [ypid_]

* Improved performance of common constructor calls by factor 6! [ypid_]
* Extend error tolerance. [ypid_]

.. _ES2015 modules: http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html
.. _rollup: http://rollupjs.org/

Fixed
~~~~~

* Fix Russian public holiday definitions. Regions where not in local language and thus not matched properly. [ypid_]
* Fix school holiday selector code which caused the main selector traversal
  function to not advance any further (returning closed for all following dates) after the
  school holiday selector code hit a holiday definition ending on the last
  day of the year. [ypid_]
* Fix ``check-diff-%.js`` Makefile target. :command:`git diff` might not have
  shown changes or returned with an error before. [ypid_]


v3.5.0_ - 2017-02-17
--------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

* Use ``peerDependencies`` to allow dependency reuse by other npm packages. [pke_, ypid_]

  * Germany, Saxony: Add missing "Buß- und Bettag" to the public holiday definition of  [bugvillage_, ypid_]
  * Fix the `getDateOfWeekdayInDateRange` helper function used to calculate PH of
    Sweden and Germany Saxony. PH definitions using this functions might have
    been wrong before. [ypid_]

* Fix timezone problem in ``PH_SH_exporter.js`` (local time was interpreted as UTC). [ypid_]
* Fix handling of legacy 12-hour clock format. ``12:xxAM`` and ``12:xxPM`` was handled incorrectly! [ypid_]
* Fix timezone issue for `PH_SH_exporter.js` unless the ``--omit-date-hyphens`` option was given.
  Exported dates which are in DST might be wrong when your system is in a
  timezone with DST and DST was not active when you run the script. [ypid_]
* Fix current week number calculation which was caused by incorrect use of
  ``new Date()`` which is a "Reactive" variable. [spawn-guy_]
