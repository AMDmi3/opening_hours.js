'unexpected token': 'Unexpected token: "__token__" This means that the syntax is not valid at that point or it is currently not supported.'
'no string': 'The value (first parameter) is not a string.'
'nothing': 'The value contains nothing meaningful which can be parsed.'
'nothing useful': 'This rule does not contain anything useful. Please remove this empty rule.'
'programmers joke': 'Might it be possible that you are a programmer and adding a semicolon after each statement is hardwired in your muscle memory ;) ? The thing is that the semicolon in the opening_hours syntax is defined as rule separator. So for compatibility reasons you should omit this last semicolon.'
'interpreted as year': 'The number __number__ will be interpreted as year. This is probably not intended. Times can be specified as "12:00".'
'rule before fallback empty': 'Rule before fallback rule does not contain anything useful'
'hour min separator': 'Please use ":" as hour/minute-separator'

'selector multi 2a': '__what__ in one rule. You may only use one in one rule.'
'selector multi 2b': 'not connected __what__ in one rule. This is probably an error. Equal selector types can (and should) always be written in conjunction separated by comma. Example for time ranges "12:00-13:00,15:00-18:00". Example for weekdays "Mo-We,Fr".'

'months': months

'ranges': ranges
'default state': 'This rule which changes the default state (which is closed) for all following rules is not the first rule. The rule will overwrite all previous rules. It can be legitimate to change the default state to open for example and then only specify for which times the facility is closed.'
'vague': 'This rule is not very explicit because there is no time selector being used. Please add a time selector to this rule or use a comment to make it more explicit.'
'empty comment': 'You have used an empty comment. Please either write something in the comment or use the keyword unknown instead.'

'strange 24/7': 'You used 24/7 in a way that is probably not interpreted as "24 hours 7 days a week". For correctness you might want to use "open" or "closed" for this rule and then write your exceptions which should achieve the same goal and is more clear e.g. "open; Mo 12:00-14:00 off".'
'public holiday': 'There was no PH (public holiday) specified. This is not very explicit.__part2__ Please either append a "PH off" rule if the amenity is closed on all public holidays or use something like "Sa,Su,PH 12:00-16:00" to say that on Saturdays, Sundays and on public holidays the amenity is open 12:00-16:00. If the amenity is open everyday including public holidays then you can make this explicit by writing "Mo-Su,PH". If you are not certain try to find it out. If you can’t then do not add PH to the value and ignore this warning.'
'public holiday part2': ' Unfortunately the tag key (e.g. "opening_hours", or "lit") is unknown to opening_hours.js. This warning only applies to the key __keys__. If your value is for that key than read on. If not you can ignore the following.'
'additional_rule_separator not used after time wrapping midnight': >-
  This rule overwrites parts of the previous rule.
  This happens because normal rules apply to the whole day and overwrite any definition made by previous rules.
  You can make this rule an additional rule by using a "," instead of the normal ";" to separate the rules.
  Note that the overwriting can also be desirable in which case you can ignore this warning.
